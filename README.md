# STEGANOGRAPHY-
Steganography is a popular technique which refers to
hiding of data within some form of other ordinary, plain
file, be it in text, image, audio or video file. Our project is
based on implementing the various aspects of
steganography to help those people who do not have a
technical background or sound knowledge about this
subject. The applications of steganography are wide and
useful. Our aim is that anyone who wishes to use
steganalysis and steganography but are not able to do
so, can now reach a platform where their technical skills
do not form a barrier in their work. Our trustworthy and
efficient web application will not just provide the options
to the user regarding the choice of cover file they want
to use, but also use encryption to protect the files from
third-parties, hence ensuring both convenience and
privacy.
In this project we will first design some algorithms which
will help us in implementing the image and audio
steganography. These algorithms will be discussed
further in methodology section. After that we will design
the webpages of our website by using HTML and CSS.
We will add dynamic aspects to our web pages by using
Java Script, SAAS and React JS. After this we will make
our backend of the website by using Django (a Python
Framework). Django will allow us to maintain our
database and also will help the user to upload their text,
images and audio files. Django will also perform the
CSRF Tokens which will prevent the Cross Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) and will keep the data our users secure.
